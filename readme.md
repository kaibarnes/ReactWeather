# Weather App
This is a simple web app I made to show the weather, in order to practice getting data from an API using React.

It uses Axios and the Open Weather Map API to get the weather from the location searched for, then updates the state to render the current temperature to the screen.

The front end was build with React and Foundation. Foundation was used to quickly provide some simple styling to the app as the main focus was to practice calling an API.
